        <p>
            i have always been one to really 
            think and think and think when it
            comes to the question of “what
            do i want to do?” this process
            was absolutely no different for 
            me. here i was thinking about 
            what i wanted my last hoorah to
            be in this program. i still 
            think about that now, but now 
            everyone says they are so excited
            to see the end of my project, 
            and i think that makes this 
            whole thing even more intimidating.
            this all started from pulling 
            together my interests, which 
            i’ve really narrowed down in the 
            past couple years. queerness, 
            grief, memorialization, history,
            permanence, archiving. 
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            there’s so much there to work with, but 
            i think at the root of everything,
            i like to spark emotion from the 
            viewer. i want you to feel something
            deep, leaving different than you 
            came in. at this point it almost
            feels as if it is expected of me
            to do something relating to these 
            ideas now, well, really more in 
            the history realm. what can i say,
            history is my thing: the portrayal
            of history in media, world conflict
            and the effects with that on countries,
            political upheaval, activism. i have
            become a little bit of the history
            nerd in this department…
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            when i really spent time thinking about
             this project, i wasn’t even sure the
             idea i had was the idea i wanted. i 
            found three images that felt inspirational
             to me and those centered on the ideas of 
            queerness, world war ii, and archiving. 
            from here i came up with the idea for my 
            synthesis project, really as a means to 
            combine all of these ideas together: 
            archiving queer society during world war ii.
             naturally, i want to make my life difficult,
             right? well i picked a topic that hasn’t 
            really been looked in to or documented. 
            people say to me  “when you first said this idea,
             my first thought was i didn’t know there
             were queer people during world war ii.” i
             think this really proves my point as a whole:
             the queer people were always there, they 
            just had to hide that part of their identity 
            because of how the world functioned at the 
            time. it’s not anywhere near how society is 
            now where there are so many queer people you
             will meet on a daily basis, and aspects of 
            queer life are getting documented and archived.
             during world war ii this was not the case. so
             much is unknown. that’s what draws me to this
             project. i want to see what’s out there, i want
             to find the unknown. being someone who is queer,
             it’s very different eighty years later. The
             queer people in the 1940s didn’t get the chance
             to have a voice, and embrace their identities,
             while they were alive. i want to give them a
             platform to have that voice and really just give
             them back the voice that they lost. there is so 
            much to learn from them.
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            this project is full of questions to pose to the viewer. 
            
            
            how do you access it? will it last forever? how do i handle the material? why? the list could go on and on.
             
            
            this project is one that plays off of the ideas expressed in history.
            
            
            how much should we know now that we couldn’t know then? should this be something fully accessible? something limiting? how can i make the viewer work to access the archive? how do i put constraints on the viewers interactions with the archive?
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            taking something mostly physical and archiving that in a still physical way, not really changing its’ intended function. keeping it physical in a sense where it will not last forever; taking something that was never really documented and leaving it in a way where it is only partially accessible. playing with materiality to think about how it will degrade (paper) or fade (ink) over time. limiting the access to the viewer. something on a time limit. presenting it in a physical space, with a filing cabinet. half of the archive in the “files” within it. half of it not. that half, scattered on the ground around the filing cabinet. the lifespan of the pages in the hands that touch it. 
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            how do you access the files? 
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            how do you access the files?
            thinking...
            
            
            
            do you walk over the information on the ground? 
            do you read what’s on the ground? 
            do you look from a distance? 
            how do you handle the materials, with both their actual materiality and with how it is presented? 
            are you careful? 
            do you preserve this history while it is still in front of you? 
            how do you engage with the information knowing that it could be ruined at any moment, at the hands of those interacting with it, the history being wiped away from your grasp?
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            so, again, i ask you: how do you access the files?
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            all of this is for you to decide, but you have to work a little hard to get there...
